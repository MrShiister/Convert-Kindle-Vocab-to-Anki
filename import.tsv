dummy,dummy,Introduction In the Swiss <b>canton</b> of St. ,dummy
dummy,dummy,"We can, I hope, <b>stipulate</b> that network tools negatively impact deep work. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"This advice comes from Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican <b>friar</b> and professor of moral philosophy, who during the early part of the twentieth century penned a slim but influential volume titled The Intellectual Life. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"And even then, the outcome is <b>fungible</b>, as it’s not able to separate out, for example, how much value was produced by this frequent, expensive e-mail use to offset some of its cost. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"But without clear metrics to support it, any business behavior is vulnerable to unstable whim and shifting forces, and in this volatile <b>scrum</b> deep work has fared particularly poorly. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"The second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox—responding to the latest missive with <b>alacrity</b> while others pile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive (more on this soon). ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves, they let the impending meeting each week force them to take some action on a given project and more generally provide a highly visible <b>simulacrum</b> of progress. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,She’s the New York Times’ <b>bureau</b> chief in Paris. ,dummy
dummy,dummy,"We’re instead quick to idolize these digital <b>doodads</b> as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a (dare I say, brave) new world. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"As I’ll detail in the next section, Knuth deploys a form of <b>monasticism</b> that prioritizes deep work by trying to eliminate or minimize all other types of work. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"If you’re outside this pool, its radical simplicity shouldn’t <b>evince</b> too much envy. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"After this session, he would mull over challenging ideas while walking on a <b>proscribed</b> route that started at his greenhouse and then circled a path on his property. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended <b>slog</b>. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"There is, however, an important corollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously <b>wean</b> your mind from a dependence on distraction. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,I recognize that I come across as <b>curmudgeonly</b> when talking about this issue—is there any other way to tackle it?—but it’s important to discuss because this quest for self-importance plays an important role in convincing people to continue to thoughtlessly fragment their time and attention. ,dummy
dummy,dummy,"The value of deep work vastly outweighs the value of shallow, but this doesn’t mean that you must <b>quixotically</b> pursue a schedule in which all of your time is invested in depth. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"This story is often cited as an example of Gates’s insight and boldness, but recent interviews have revealed another trait that played a crucial role in the tale’s happy ending: Gates’s <b>preternatural</b> deep work ability. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"The <b>curmudgeons</b> among us are vaguely uneasy about the attention people pay to their phones, and pine for the days of unhurried concentration, while the digital hipsters equate such nostalgia with Luddism and boredom, and believe that increased connection is the foundation for a utopian future. ",dummy
dummy,dummy,"Among other methods, I began to more carefully block out deep work hours and preserve them against <b>incursion</b>. ",dummy
